      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)‚ÄîAI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

      "Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\n",
      "Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\n",

      "Answer: {'query': 'explain the concept of the federal government ', 'result': 'The federal government is a system of governance in which power and authority are divided between a central government and individual states or provinces. In the context of the United States, the federal government refers to the national government, which is established by the U.S. Constitution. It is responsible for managing national affairs and has specific powers and responsibilities that are distinct from those of state governments.\\n\\nKey features of the U.S. federal government include:\\n\\n1. **Separation of Powers**: The federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative branch (Congress), the executive branch (headed by the President), and the judicial branch (the Supreme Court and other federal courts). Each branch has its own distinct powers and responsibilities, providing a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\\n\\n2. **Enumerated Powers**: The Constitution outlines specific powers granted to the federal government, such as regulating interstate commerce, conducting foreign affairs, and providing for national defense. Powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved for the states.\\n\\n3. **Supremacy Clause**: The Constitution, federal laws, and treaties are considered the \"supreme Law of the Land,\" meaning they take precedence over state laws when there is a conflict.\\n\\n4. **Federalism**: This is the principle that allows states to retain their own governments and powers, as long as they do not conflict with federal laws. States have their own constitutions and governments that handle local matters.\\n\\nThe federal government is designed to address issues that affect the nation as a whole, while allowing states to manage local affairs, creating a balance between unity and regional autonomy.'}\n",

Specifically, it states that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This is outlined in the Tenth Amendment. Additionally, the Constitution and federal laws made in pursuance thereof, as well as treaties made under the authority of the United States, are considered the supreme law of the land.'}\n",

The 19th Amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex.\\n3.

This dual-licensing model allows companies to cater to different user needs and business models.\\n\\nIn this model, the open-source edition often serves as a community-driven version that encourages collaboration and contributions from developers around the world.
